			## AJAX
			- an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
			- is a collection of technologies that are used to make asynchronous connections to servers.
			

			## AJAX(continued)
			- although XML is part of the acronym, nowadays JSON is preferred because it is part of JavaScript, simpler and lighter in size thanks to less formatting and structure data.
			- the fact that it is asynchronous means that it is possible to communicate with a server, submit data and update part of a webpage without having to reload the entire webpage.



			## Why we need AJAX
			- AJAX makes an application more interactive and enables it to load updates without refreshing.
			- Such features improve the user experience in everyday applications:
				- Google Workspace and Microsoft Office 365 apps automatically save changes to a file every time the user makes a change.
				- WhatsApp immediately notifies a user when a new message or post arrives in their inbox.
