## AJAX
- an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
- is a collection of technologies that are used to make asynchronous connections to servers.
- although XML is part of the acronym, nowadays JSON is preferred because it is part of JavaScript, simpler and lighter in size thanks to less formatting and structure data.
- the fact that it is asynchronous means that it is possible to communicate with a server, submit data and update part of a webpage without having to reload the entire webpage.



## Why we need AJAX
This makes an application more interactive and enables it to load updates from a server as if active.
